========

A couple small applications I made

To compile and run:
* gradle run

To create a zip:
* gradle distZip

To load in Eclipse:
* Simply import the projects as Gradle projects.

Applications:
* ChainCommander: Upload some files with clients in chain. When the client connects to the server, the server will tell him the last client connected so that he can download from that one.
* FreenetKnowledge: A local web search engine for Freenet.
* LinksValidator: Check all the links on one root website to see if some are missing.
* Savior: A library and a gui to make backups.
* UpdateWatcher: This is a program that checks the filesystem for any change and run the command. It supports to have a quiet period.
